# CSV To RDF Converter v3

## Objectives of the new version

* Manage the versions of triples and enable the deltas between versions
* Propose simple SPARQL queries based on whatever Graph

### Principles

#### Vocabulary:

* A basic triple is noted `domain1:subject domain2:predicate domain3:object .`
* We will name "data" any subject of object in a hierarchy that leads to `rdf:type` and "relation" all entities leading to `rdf:Property`

#### Principle #1

When data exist, they exist forever, independently from their version or applicability.

Data can be stamped with their creation date like `domain:data :created :April2022`.
